## React Project: Copy Cat
This program will display a textbox with a picture of a cat beneath it.  
When users type into the textbox, a copy of the text will appear below the cat image, suggesting that the cat is being a copycat.  
Clicking on the image of the cat will toggle whether or not it is able to copy the user.
