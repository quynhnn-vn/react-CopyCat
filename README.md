# React Project: Copy Cat
This program will display a textbox with a picture of a cat beneath it.  

When users type into the textbox, a copy of the text will appear below the cat image, suggesting that the cat is being a copycat.  

Clicking on the image of the cat will toggle whether or not it is able to copy the user.

### Available Scripts
Run `npm install` inside the project's root directory (make sure you have Node installed on your computer)

Run `npm start` and open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

Open [https://copycat-qnn.surge.sh/](https://copycat-qnn.surge.sh/) to view it in deployed version.
